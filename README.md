## General Information

### What is WareSmart?

WareSmart focus on protecting your warehouse against both environmental and third-party hazards. This system alerts you anytime there has been any substancial temperature or humidity change in your warehouse, as well as unauthorized movement in place.

### Smart Features

WareSmart lets you choose between various presets of what is stored in your warehouse, these being books, animals, food, wine, or many others. Depending on the temperature and humidity levels, WareSmart will notify your smartphone if any of these get out of the safe range for all of your selected presets.

WareSmart also has an integrated BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) that won't trigger your Movement detection if your phone is close enough to your warehouse (withing a 2 meter range). This feature can be turned of at will by the user.
